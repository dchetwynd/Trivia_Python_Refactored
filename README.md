This is my refactoring of the Trivia legacy code application provided by J.B. Rainsberger (github.com/jbrains/trivia). The Trivia exercise is available in many different programming languages and provides a great example of legacy code upon which developers can practice their refactoring skills.

I have chosen to refactor the Python version of the exercise. trivia_original.py contains the original code provided by J.B. Rainsberger, except for a small refactoring to allow a random seed to be provided and a correction of the typo "corrent" to "correct". game_runner.py runs the refactored code through a game runner, so that its output can be compared to the original version when the same random seed is used. trivia_refactored.py provides my refactored version of the code. Tests have been written with unittest to ensure that the refactorings did not change the behaviour of the original code.
